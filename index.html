            <p><a href="https://e6.365dm.de/22/09/1600x900/skysport_de-ronaldo-portugal_5906577.jpg?20220921112110"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: brown;" href="">Cristiano Ronaldo</a></a> confirmed that the European Championship in Germany will be <br> "without a doubt" the last of his impressive career.</p>
            <p>The 2024 Euros mark Ronaldo's <a style="text-decoration: none;color: brown;" href="https://jang.com.pk/en/15199-cristiano-ronaldo-declares-euro-2024-as-his-last-tournament-news">record-breaking sixth appearance</a> in a European <br> Championships.</p>
            <p>The next tournament will be hosted by the United Kingdom and the Republic of <br> Ireland in four years, when Ronaldo will be 43.</p>
<p>"Without a doubt it's the last Euro [for me], of course it is," Ronaldo told Portugal <br> TV's RTP.</p>
<p>"But I'm not emotional about that. I'm moved by everything that football entails, <br> by the enthusiasm I have for the game, the enthusiasm I see in the fans, having <br> my family here, people's passion... it's not about leaving the world of football. What <br> else is there for me to do or win?"</p>
<p>Ronaldo, who made his debut with <a style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;" href="">Portugal</a> in 2003 and won the tournament 2016, is the <br> men's all-time leading scorer with 130 goals.</p>
<p>"The most important thing about the journey I've been on is the enthusiasm I still have for <br> being here," he said.</p>
<p>"It's 20 years representing and playing with the national team, bringing joy to people, to <br> the family, my children, that is what motivates me most."</p>
<p>Ronaldo's mental strength was tested on Monday when he saw his 114th-minute penalty <br> shot kept out by <a style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;" href="">Slovenia</a> goalkeeper <a style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;" href="">Jan Oblak.</a></p>
<p>Portugal won the round-of-16 game, beating Slovenia in a penalty shootout that saw <br> Portuguese goalkeeper <a style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;" href="">Diogo Costa</a> save all three of Slovenia's attempts.</p>
<p>The <a  style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;" href="">Al Nassr</a> superstar <a style="color: brown; text-decoration: none; href="">broke down in tears</a> as the game went to a penalty shootout and <br> had to be consoled by his teammates.</p>
<p>"It's football; those who fail are those who try, too," Ronaldo said. "I will always do my best <br> for this shirt, whether I fail or not.
